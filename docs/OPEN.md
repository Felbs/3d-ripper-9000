# Open formats - what is left to crack

Live list, updated as work happens.  Ordered by return: discs affected first, then how close it
is to falling.  A format only leaves this list when it ships and a real disc yields models or
textures through the plugin chain.

Companion to [FORMATS.md](FORMATS.md), which lists what already works.

## Close - one focused session each

| format | discs | state | what is blocking |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blitz `common_*` formats 17 and 19 | up to 9 | descriptor chain and formats 15 (`RGBA8`) / 21 (`CMPR`) ship | what codes 17 and 19 encode - 10 and 1 of a 60-pack sample |
| Terminal Reality `_dfm` | 3 (BloodRayne, Blowout, RoadKill) | 28 rigid parts, one bone index each; 46 geometry records of 36 bytes; 20-byte vertex by size arithmetic; `HVSI` skeleton reads with a correct anatomical parent tree | the vertex field layout.  Normal-agreement search is useless here - every high-scoring fit is planar-degenerate.  Needs an anchor that is not normals |
| FSTA `GKA` / `GGG` | 2 (Billy & Mandy, Kids Next Door) | **not compressed** - body entropy 5.28 (`GGG`) and 6.82 (`GKA`) against 7.73 for `GMS`.  Magic is `ISVH` (`HVSI` reversed) but the fields are big-endian: the `u32` at +12 is the exact file size on both | what they hold.  Neither shows f32 runs, so any geometry is quantised.  Note the models are in `GMS`, which is compressed - these may be animation or collision |

## Mapped but blocked on a codec

| format | discs | state |
|---|---|---|
| `.hog` WART3.00 | 7 (Harry Potter x2, Looney Tunes, Animaniacs, Tiger Woods x3) | directory walks by tiling; every member compressed with a private LZ.  Four standard LZSS variants fail within a few bytes |
| High Voltage `GMS` | 2 (Billy & Mandy, Kids Next Door) | header readable, size field exact; **payload entropy 7.73 behind a 2.39 header** - compressed, and not zlib / Yaz0 / Yay0 |

Both need bit-level reverse engineering of a private codec before any geometry exists to parse.
Worth saying plainly: there is no mesh layout to hunt in either until the codec falls.

## Mapped, needs a session

| format | discs | state |
|---|---|---|
| TotemTech `.dgc` | 3 (Spirits & Spells, Jimmy Neutron, SpongeBob) | face-run scanning yields ~200-450 meshes/disc but merged levels are wrong; **the file has no directory at all** - nothing anywhere references the verified vertex array.  Exact extraction needs sequential parsing of the whole serialized stream from byte 0 |
| Asobo `.dgc` (Ratatouille) | 1 | **Asobo Studio "Internal Cross Technology"**.  Container mapped: 24-byte big-endian directory at 0x120 (`type | uncompressed | stored | block size | hash`), payload back to back, and **raw when uncompressed == stored and block size is 0** - 16 of 55 records, 29% of the archive, needs no codec.  Uniform 150/160 KB chunks mean it is a **paged virtual file system**, so cracking the codec yields an address space, not files - the name-to-page directory is a second problem.  See [formats/asobo-ict-dgc.md](formats/asobo-ict-dgc.md) |
| Darkened Skye `.skg` skeletons | 1 | `SKX` models ship (255 of 255, 135,749 triangles) and their skinning records give a joint index and weight per influence, but the positions are in **joint space** and there is no skeleton in the `SKX`.  The 17 `.skg` files open `\0GKS` and name a model, so the bone transforms are almost certainly there.  Until they are bound the exporter takes the first influence, which is coherent but not exact on multi-joint models | see [formats/darkened-skye.md](formats/darkened-skye.md) |
| Bleach GC | 1 | `chr.afs` / `scenario.afs` / `com.afs` / `stg.afs`, members open `16 00 00 00`; untagged structured records |
| Gotcha Force, Gundam vs Z, Auto Modellista, Capcom vs SNK 2 | 4 | data AFS identified per disc; inner formats untouched |
| `.arc` (cluster 2) | 4 (Cabela's x3, Over the Hedge) | **Cabela's**: a chain of raw zlib streams at 0x800-aligned offsets, ~2 MB each; `generic` already inflates the first.  Not shipped as a container - gxscan finds nothing in an inflated block and none of gcrip's magics appear, so it would cost ~600 MB of inflation per disc for no output.  **Over the Hedge**: `datasets.arc` (399 MB) is the only untouched data archive; `levels.arc` is entity script data.  Mega Man X Collection is a dead end (emulated 2D games) | see [formats/cluster2-arc.md](formats/cluster2-arc.md) |
| `res` `node` scene graph | 3 (Samurai Jack, Lemony Snicket, Digimon Rumble Arena 2) | `rdms` meshes ship (93,000 of them, 7.4 million triangles) but each comes out in its own space; the `node` sections are what would place them in a level, and `surf` textures are not matched to the meshes that use them | see [formats/res-rdms-meshes.md](formats/res-rdms-meshes.md) |
| Hunter `AGM` / `AGD` materials | 1 | `AGG` meshes ship (781,658 triangles) and carry their material **names**, and the `LJAM` archives hold 3,865 `TPL` beside them, but the text that maps one to the other (`MatAssignment` / `MaterialDatabase`, 3,465 files) is not read, so the meshes come out untextured | see [formats/high-voltage-ljam.md](formats/high-voltage-ljam.md) |
| `.jam` `JAM2` | 1 (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, 38 files, 244 MB) | a different format from `LJAM`: `JAM2`, a float, a size, then a compression name (`none`, `safe`) and a string table (`ASCRIPT`, `DFE000AB`).  Untouched | |
| `bin`/`dat` tail | many | cluster 10, never started |

## Dead ends - confirmed, do not re-probe

| thing | why |
|---|---|
| `.rws` | RenderWare **audio**, chunk 0x080d.  Not geometry |
| `.wad` (Neversoft) | audio; Gun's real data is 2,918 hashed `.ngc` files with no common magic |
| `.fsb` | FMOD sound banks - 5 discs |
| most AFS archives | ADX audio and MPEG video.  R - Racing, Soul Calibur II, Viewtiful Joe 2 and Sonic Riders have nothing else in theirs |
| `.mpq` (WWE x3) | video packs |
| Mega Man X Collection | emulated 2D games - there is no 3D geometry on the disc |
| TMNT world materials | genuinely untextured in the source data |

## Cross-cutting traps worth re-reading before writing any plugin

1. **`detect` and `is_container` get 64 bytes.**  `gcrip.classify.SNIFF_BYTES`.  A check that
   reads past byte 64 returns False for every real file, silently.  This has bitten three times
   (`pod`, `tr_pkg`, `dds_pack`) and once dormantly (`billy_lnd`, which cost Billy Hatcher its
   79 terrain files).  Detect on the magic, validate in `expand`/`extract`.
2. **A container needs a no-op `detect`/`extract` pair** or `all_plugins()` never registers it.
   `afs` and `lpac` were dead this way - 31 discs of AFS archives were never expanded.
3. **Normal agreement cannot search for a layout.**  On a near-planar point set every face
   normal agrees and the metric saturates above 0.98.  Use it to confirm a layout you already
   have; add a non-degeneracy guard when searching.
4. **Matching magic is not matching layout.**  High Voltage's TPL carries Nintendo's exact
   magic and a different header.
5. **`gcrip dump` is one single-threaded process - use `--shard i/n`.**  A single worker used
   **1% of a 64-core machine** with the disk at 0%; six shards over one `--out` took it to 20%.
   The run is resumable (finished discs are skipped from `batch_results.jsonl`), so switching a
   running pass to shards costs nothing.  Do not go wide enough to thrash the single spindle that
   holds both the ISOs and the dump.
6. **A disc queued for a pass has no dump directory.**  Pass 7 deletes each game's folder before
   re-ripping it, so `disc_manifest.json` vanishes mid-run and any tooling that reads offsets from
   the dump breaks.  Read the ISO directly, or keep a local sample, for anything on the pass list.
7. **Measure from the right offset.**  Blitz format 21 looked like an unknown codec at 0.39
   bytes per pixel purely because the pixel data was measured from 0x1000 instead of from each
   descriptor.
8. **An index array can address more than one vertex array.**  Darkened Skye's 16-byte triangle carries
   two `u16` triples - one into the positions, one into the uvs.  Reading the first triple against the
   wrong array parsed 157 of 255 models and looked like a coverage problem rather than a layout one,
   because the uv array is usually the larger of the two so most indices happened to fit.
9. **A float array in [0,1] on a textured model is uvs, not normalised geometry.**  Assuming the latter
   cost a pass on Darkened Skye and produced the wrong conclusion that the format had no vertex array.
10. **An array offset can be relative to its own header word.**  `res` `rdms` stores five array
    offsets in a row and each is measured from where it sits, so any single base makes the first
    array right and every later one wrong by four bytes more than the last.  That is what "consistently one element short" meant.
